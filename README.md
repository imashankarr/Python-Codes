# Python-Codes

Write a program to read in and solve path-finding puzzles. Each puzzle consists of a sequence of
integers, like this:
3 6 4 1 3 4 2 5 3 0
The orange color on the first square indicates your current position. At each step in the puzzle, you
may move exactly the number of squares indicated by the integer in the square you are in. You may
move either left or right along the row but may not move past either end. For example, the only
legal first move is to move three squares to the right because there is no room to move three spaces
to the left. The goal of the puzzle is to move the marker to the end of the row. 

Write a function called solve which takes a list of integers (the problem) representing the elements
of the puzzle, and tries to find a path from the first location to the last location.
